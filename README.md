# BestPractice
A Best Practices analysis tool for FME Workspaces

The easiest way to install this project is to download/fork it onto a local machine and in FME use Tools > FME Options > Default Paths, add the download folder as a Shared FME Folder.

Because the download folder includes subfolders for Workspaces and CustomTransformers, FME Workbench will automatically locate and install this functionality on startup.

Open and run the main workspace, pointing its published parameters to the workspace you wish to analyze.

A HTML report will be generated on the Best Practices used in developing that workspace.
